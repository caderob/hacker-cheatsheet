Lab 1 - Which of the following is not a strategy used in teaching this section?
>A. Showing the solution first, then explaining why and how it works.

Lab 2 - In this short Learning Unit, we focused on our central Module, the executable permission, but we also introduced and discussed other commands that allowed us to copy files and list file properties. Including some additional items like this is a strategy known as what?
>B. Interleaving

Lab 3 - At one point in this section, we tried running a command (chmod) on a file and it didn't work. Rather than quickly abandoning this line of thinking, we tried running the exact same command on itself, which also didn't work. This type of optimistic persistence is important to learn. OffSec has a two word name for this mentality. What is it?
>TRY harder

Lab 4 - Assume that in a normal Module, this material would have been accompanied by a virtual machine, which would have allowed the learner to follow along. The approach used here addresses several of the challenges discussed earlier in this Module. While this example wasn't perfect, which challenge is definitely not addressed in this particular teaching method (but can be addressed with the learner's approach to learning)?
>B. Too much information at once, leading to cognitive load.
