# Balancing the Triad with Organizational Objectives

Lab 1 - Which property of the CIA triad does having a reasonable password length policy help protect?
>Confidentiality

Lab 2 - Which property of the CIA triad does a strong encryption algorithm help protect?
>Confidentiality

Lab 3 - Which property of the CIA triad does hashing and checksums help protect?
>integrity

Lab 4 - Bank Corp has a form on their website. The code that processes form submissions doesn't sanitize certain parameters. This enables any user to change values stored in tables on a SQL database. As a result, the user can change the amount of money that they have in their accounts. This is an example of a breach of which CIA triad property?
>integrity

Lab 5 - Acme Co accidentally left an AWS S3 bucket unsecured, which allowed anyone to access sensitive personally identifiable data. This is an example of a breach of which CIA triad property?
>confidentiality

Lab 6 - Hope Hospital holds all of its data on a single server with no backups. One day, a janitor accidentally trips on the cord, yanking it from the socket and disconnecting the server the staff relies on. This is an example of a breach of which CIA triad property
>availability

Lab 7 - For the following questions, refer to this scenario: In 2016, Linux Mint was compromised. The attackers were able to gain access to the web server that hosted their ISO downloads, and replace them with different ISOs that contained backdoors installed on them. They also changed the publicly visible checksums of the ISOs on the same site. The Linux Mint administrators identified the issue and resolved it within 24 hours. Part of their discovery was that the ISOs and checksums, which were downloadable via a torrent (a way to download a file on a peer-to-peer network), were not impacted by the breach. Which part of the CIA triad was impacted when the attackers changed the ISO files on the website?
>integrity

Lab 8 - Which part of the CIA triad was impacted when the attackers gained access to the web server before any modifications were made?
>confidentiality

Lab 9 - Suppose attackers decided to remove all critical files on a web server, preventing the server from functioning in the intended way. Which part of the CIA triad would have been impacted?
>availability

Lab 10 - What part of the CIA triad is Linux Mint addressing by having two download locations?
>availability
