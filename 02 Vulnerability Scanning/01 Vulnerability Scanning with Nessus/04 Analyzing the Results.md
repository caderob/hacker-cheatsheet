# Analyzing the Results

Lab 1 - In the section "Performing a Vulnerability scan" we launched a vulnerability scan on four target machines. Follow the steps outlined in this section to review the results of this scan and analyze the Apache 2.4.49 < 2.4.51 Path Traversal Vulnerability finding. The finding contains a field named Exploit Code Maturity. Enter the value of this field as an answer to this exercise.
>``` shell
>1. Select completed scan
>2. Select the tab titled "Vulnerabilities"
>3. Select the vulnerability group titled "Apache HTTP Server (Multiple Issues)"
>4. Select the vulnerability titled "Apache 2.4.49 < 2.4.51 Path Traversal Vulnerability"
>5. Find the "Exploit Code Maturity" value under "VPR Key Drivers" on the right side of the page.
>```

Lab 2 - Perform an unauthenticated vulnerability scan on the same four machines (VM Group 1) as in the previous exercise, but only scan port 8080. Once the scan finishes, review the scan results and identify a host with the grouped finding HTTP (Multiple Issues). Find HTTP Server Type and Version and enter the Jetty version found.
>``` shell
>1. kali@kali:~/Downloads$ sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
>2. Navigate to https://127.0.0.1:8834
>3. Create a Scan
>4. Select a Basic Network Scan
>5. Configure Scan Name and Target List in Settings
>6. Select Custom Discovery Settings and Enter Specific Port (8080)
>7. Disable Host Ping in Discovery Settings
>8. Launch the Scan
>9. Select completed scan
>10. Select the tab titled "Vulnerabilities"
>11. Select the vulnerability group titled "HTTP (Multiple Issues)"
>12. Select the vulnerability titled "HTTP Server Type and Version"
>13. Find the remote web server (Jetty) version number
>```
>9.4.43.v20210629

Lab 3 - Nessus can build a Sitemap of a target web server. A Sitemap provides information about the content of a web server (e.g. pages). Nessus builds it by crawling through links it identifies on pages. Scan the four target machines ( VM Group 1) on port 9999 with the Basic Network Scan template. To configure Nessus to build a Sitemap, click on the Assessment settings in the scan configuration and select Custom in the dropdown menu. Next, click on Web Applications and activate Scan web applications. After this, launch the scan. Once it is finished, review the results and analyze the findings on the Web Application Sitemap . The output provides a list of found pages. On one of these pages, you will find the flag.
>``` shell
>1. kali@kali:~/Downloads$ sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
>2. Navigate to https://127.0.0.1:8834
>3. Create a Scan
>4. Select a Basic Network Scan
>5. Configure Scan Name and Target List in Settings
>6. Select Custom Discovery Settings and Enter Specific Port (9999)
>7. Disable Host Ping in Discovery Settings
>8. Select Custom Assessment Settings 
>9. Activate "Scan web applications" in Assessment Settings
>10. Launch the Scan
>11. Select completed scan
>12. Select the tab titled "Vulnerabilities"
>13. Select the vulnerability titled "Web Application Sitemap"
>14. http://192.168.170.13:9999/flag.html
>```

Lab 4 - The victim machine VM #5 is running a server that contains several vulnerabilities. One vulnerability allows for directory traversal and arbitrary file access on the target system. Use Nessus to perform a Basic Network Scan of the victim. Make sure to configure the scan to assess all ports. Once the scan is completed, examine the discovered vulnerability in the results. As a part of the scan, Nessus was able to read the file C:\Windows\win.ini as a proof of concept of this exploit. Expand the vulnerability results to view the full content of the retrieved file and locate the embedded flag.
>``` shell
>1. kali@kali:~/Downloads$ sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
>2. Navigate to https://127.0.0.1:8834
>3. Create a Scan
>4. Select a Basic Network Scan
>5. Configure Scan Name and Target List in Settings
>6. Select "Port scan (all ports)" in Discovery Settings
>7. Launch the Scan
>8. Select completed scan
>9. Select the tab titled "Vulnerabilities"
>10. Select the vulnerability titled "Web Server Directory Traversal Arbitrary File Access"
>11. Locate the flag in the "Output" section
>```
