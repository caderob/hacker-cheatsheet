Lab 2 - The target machine VM #2 is running an IIS web server. Perform an Advanced Dynamic Scan on this system with the default settings of this template and specify the Plugin ID 11714 in a Plugin Filter. Once the scan completes, examine the discovered information and locate the flag embedded in the disclosed path. Keep in mind, that Nessus shows some special characters like "{" or "}" as Unicode Hex characters. To provide the correct flag, you will need to substitute these characters.
