# Hacker Cheatsheet

This repository serves as a comprehensive compilation of notes and commands assembled during my preparation for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification, specifically the PEN-200 course undertaken in 2025. 

The purpose of this cheatsheet is to provide a structured and concise reference to aid in the understanding and execution of various penetration testing techniques covered in the OSCP curriculum.

> **Note:** This cheatsheet was created for use with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) app. Additional folders like `Medtech`, `OSCP A`, `OSCP B`, and `Secura` contain notes and artifacts related to Challenge Lab exercises used for hands-on practice and skill reinforcement.
