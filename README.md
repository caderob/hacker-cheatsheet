# Hacker Cheatsheet

This repository serves as a comprehensive compilation of notes and commands assembled during my preparation for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification, specifically the PEN-200 course undertaken in 2025. 

The purpose of this cheatsheet is to provide a structured and concise reference to aid in the understanding and execution of various penetration testing techniques covered in the OSCP curriculum.
